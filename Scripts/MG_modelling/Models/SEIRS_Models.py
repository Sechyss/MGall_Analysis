#%% ODE Model
def SEIRS_first_model(y, t, params):
    """
    SEIRS model testing virulence-transmission trade-off with symptom-targeting drug.
    
    Biological assumptions:
    - Transmission requires symptoms (sneezing, coughing)
    - Drug reduces symptoms but doesn't eliminate pathogen
    - High-virulence: produces strong symptoms → treated individuals still transmit
    - Low-virulence: produces mild symptoms → treatment eliminates transmission
    
    This tests hypothesis: Can drugs that mask symptoms allow "super-virulent" strains
    to evolve by removing the constraint that high virulence = immobile/dead hosts?
    
    State vector y (length 9): [S, Eh, Indh, Idh, Rh, El, Indl, Idl, Rl]
    
    Parameters (11):
    - beta_l: baseline transmission rate (low-virulence)
    - birth_rate, death_rate: demographic rates
    - delta: rate of waning immunity
    - delta_d: detection/treatment rate (proportion diagnosed)
    - p_recover: treatment efficacy (proportion that recover faster)
    - phi_recover: recovery rate modifier for high-strain (SET TO 1.0 for no effect currently)
    - phi_transmission: transmission multiplier for high-strain (e.g., 1.05 = 5% higher R0)
    - sigma: recovery rate
    - tau: 1/latent period
    - theta: treatment coverage (proportion of detected cases treated)
    
    Future extensions via phi_recover:
    - < 1.0: high-virulence has longer infectious period (more virulent = sicker longer)
    - > 1.0: high-virulence has shorter infectious period (burn out faster)

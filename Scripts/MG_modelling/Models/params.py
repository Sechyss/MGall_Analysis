# Experimental design notes:
# - theta kept LOW (0.3) to allow dose-response studies (vary 0.3 → 0.9)
# - Equal strain seeding (5 each) tests competitive dynamics
# - R0 difference (5%) tests subtle evolutionary advantage
# - Asymmetric transmission: Idh contributes, Idl doesn't (symptom-masking hypothesis)

# Optional: recommended ranges for sensitivity analysis
# theta: 0.0 - 0.9 (vary treatment coverage)
# p_recover: 1.1 - 2.0 (vary treatment efficacy)
# phi_transmission: 1.01 - 1.2 (vary virulence advantage)
# delta: 1/365 (1 year) - 1/30 (1 month) (vary immunity duration)
